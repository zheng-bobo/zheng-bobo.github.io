For more than five years, I worked on the core engineering and technical leadership of real-time collaborative documents at Kingsoft Office. My work spanned system and application architecture, core implementation, code review, performance engineering, and team delivery. I care about more than making a feature run: I want systems to remain understandable, reliable, and evolvable under high concurrency, long-lived connections, and failure.

Since September 2025, I have been pursuing an MSc in Computer Science at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/computer-science), with a focus on **Advanced Computing and Systems** and **Artificial Intelligence**. This has given me a research lens for ideas I first encountered in production: distributed systems and data-intensive applications, now extended to AI systems, agents, and model inference.

I enjoy taking complex technology apart through its data flow, concurrency model, network protocol, and performance limits, until I can explain, test, and implement it. This blog documents that process through notes on Go and systems programming, distributed systems, Transformers, AI agents, courses, and engineering lessons.

  <section class="about-work-item">
    <p class="about-work-label">REAL-TIME COLLABORATION</p>
    <h3>Collaborative documents</h3>
    <p>Worked on architecture, core systems, and backend performance, and received two invention patents covering collaborative-session scheduling and text-aware image compression.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="about-work-item">
    <p class="about-work-label">HIGH-PERFORMANCE NETWORKING</p>
    <h3>Go RPC at connection scale</h3>

## Current interests

I am most interested in **systems for AI**: reliable runtimes for models and agents, efficient inference and retrieval, and evaluation and feedback loops that enable systems to improve. I also continue to explore distributed data systems, high-performance networking, Go, Rust, and cloud-native infrastructure.

I believe good engineering is not about accumulating complexity. It is about finding the right abstractions so that a system remains understandable as it grows. Writing is one way I turn fuzzy experience into knowledge I can examine and share.
